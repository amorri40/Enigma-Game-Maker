LibFFI is a cross platform set of functions supporting all sorts of calling conventions,
including cdecl and stdcall for DLLs on Windows. It's one of the most useful libraries I
have run into, despite the fact that aside from ENIGMA, I can't think of any another use
for it. At any rate, LibFFI is the reason external_define and the sort work on the fly.

I didn't include the source for reasons of size. Instead, this folder contains a static
library I built for Windows. Specifically, this is version 3.0.10.

You can download the full source, with any updates, at the official website.
